How can we create more natural looking textures like the surface of roads, rocks, trees and clouds? Noise functions are the answer.
Since Ken Perlin invented his first noise algorithm in 80's, the technique has been extensively used throughout computer graphics and simulations. Even if you have never heard of the name, it's unlikely you have not seen it. Let's take a step by step look at how the function is built and works. We also cover a more efficient version of the algorithm called simplex noise.
